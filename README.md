Description- 
The design of the mockup for the Pokédex website was thoughtfully crafted with a cheerful yellow color palette and the playful "Schoolbell" font to evoke the fun and whimsical nature of the Pokémon universe. Yellow, as a primary color, was chosen for its ability to capture attention and convey positivity, creating an inviting atmosphere for users. Complementary colors like soft blues and greens were strategically incorporated to provide contrast, ensuring important elements stand out while maintaining a cohesive look. The "Schoolbell" font was selected for its informal and friendly appearance, enhancing readability for users of all ages. The layout emphasizes responsiveness, enabling a seamless experience across devices, with a flexible grid system for easy access to Pokémon cards and information. Navigation is intuitive, featuring a sticky header that guides users through sections like Home, Pokémon List, About, and Contact. Each Pokémon is presented in visually appealing cards, making essential information easily accessible while employing hover effects for interactivity. High-quality images bring the characters to life, fostering a deeper connection with users. Call-to-action buttons, designed in a contrasting shade of yellow or complementary colors, encourage engagement with clear hover effects. Consistency across the website is maintained through a defined style guide that governs the use of colors, typography, and layouts, reinforcing a cohesive brand identity. Overall, the mockup aims to create an engaging, user-friendly experience that invites users to explore and learn about their favorite Pokémon in a vibrant and interactive environment.
